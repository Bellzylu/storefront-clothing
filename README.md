# 💫 **Wishlist feature for byTiMo** 💫 

 This project introduces a nice-to-have wishlist feature, based on a use case for the brand and online store, byTiMo. The goal with this 
 feature is to make the shopping experience personalized and interactive. 
 Developed using Next.js and CSS Modules, this feature is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly interface for byTiMo 
 customers. The design is pretty basic and should be improved further. However, the main goal for this project was to use the provided 
 APIs to set up the main functionalities that were planned for the feature ⭐️ First, let's have a sneak peak:

 ## **Features** 🎪
 You should have seen them all in the screen recording, but to sum it up,
 as a user you can:
 * search for products by name(in the product list), 
 * add and remove items to your wishlist
 * copy the current url (this means also your saved wishlist).
You also choose between different currencies (and hope they exist for your product).
   However, NOK always exist so that is your safest bet for now! 
 
Also, in this app, you can see how the UI component have been tested by clicking on the "Storyless" button.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

3. Open your localhost and enjoy!


## Incomplete features / Suggestions for further development

*  The currency feature need some better handling of cases where the currency is not available for certain products (perhaps I overlooked something in the API- ready for feedback on this one)

*  The photo displaying "404" when there is no image, is a short cut solution. 
*  Search works, but one could add more parameters to search by.
*  Also, sorting between catagories would be nice too! <3 
*  Not been tested on Android and Edge! ⚠️ 
*  Better error handling and some nice looking loaders
*  Design: Place info better (show more info when clicking on a product or quickview feature), and have slightly more seamless design.. 

   I added a few comments in the code with "TODO:" , just to remember where I can improve ☠️
